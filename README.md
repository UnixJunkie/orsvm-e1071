# orsvm-e1071
Access from OCaml the RBF-kernel-SVM provided by the R e1071 package.

This is low level on purpose: we don't provide access to all functionalities offered by the module.

This is probably not high performance: data are exchanged between R and OCaml via ASCII files.

This project is part of the poor lonesome cowboy's plan to enhance
the OCaml ecosystem in the Machine Learning field.
